      <description>The other day I had a request to rename some files (i.e. &amp;ldquo;we have millions of files that all need to be renamed can you do that?&amp;quot;).
I said of course, and thankfully it was the same change that needed to be done for every file. The leading 1 of the files needed to be replaced with a 0. There was a large conversion going on from one software program to another and this was part of how they were tracking the migrations of the files.</description>
