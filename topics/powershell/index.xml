      <description>The other day I had a request to rename some files (i.e. &amp;ldquo;we have millions of files that all need to be renamed can you do that?&amp;quot;).
I said of course, and thankfully it was the same change that needed to be done for every file. The leading 1 of the files needed to be replaced with a 0. There was a large conversion going on from one software program to another and this was part of how they were tracking the migrations of the files.</description>

      <title>FormatEnumerationLimit - Reduce Truncating Output</title>

      <description>Sometimes there is output from a cmdlet that gets truncated on the screen, even though there is more space to fill in the console window.
To not truncate the output of your PowerShell commands set the variable $FormatEnumerationLimit to -1
$FormatEnumerationLimit=-1Now the output from cmdlets will fill the console window.
So what is the $FormatEnumerationLimit variable? Here is the definition from the about_preferences doc:
 $FormatEnumerationLimit Determines how many enumerated items are included in a display.</description>
